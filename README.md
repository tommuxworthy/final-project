I worked independently to produce an app that calculated the amount of carbon emissions to be offset based on the userâ€™s travel history.  I used a Python Django API and Django REST Framework to serve my data from a Postgres database, whilst the front-end was built with React. I incorporated multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for two models, users and flights.
